        IP address of the client. If a transaction is only a client sending
        INFORM messages then there is no lease information exchanged so this

        field does require that the client sources at least one DHCP message
        using a non-broadcast address.

        Added by DHCP relay agents which terminate switched or permanent
        circuits. It encodes an agent-local identifier of the circuit from
        which a DHCP client-to-server packet was received. Typically it
        should represent a router or switch interface number.

        The subscriber ID is a value independent of the physical network
        configuration so that a customer's DHCP configuration can be given
        to them correctly no matter where they are physically connected.
