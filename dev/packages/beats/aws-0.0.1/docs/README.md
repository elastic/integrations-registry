# AWS Integration

This integration is used to fetches logs and metrics from 
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Logs

### cloudtrail

The `cloudtrail` dataset collects the AWS CloudTrail logs. CloudTrail monitors 
events for the account. If user creates a trail, it delivers those events as log
 files to a specific Amazon S3 bucket. The `cloudtrail` dataset does not read 
 the CloudTrail Digest files that are delivered to the S3 bucket when Log File 
 Integrity is turned on, it only reads the CloudTrail logs.
