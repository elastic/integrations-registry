    fields:
    - description: |
        Actual used memory in bytes. It represents the difference between the total and the available memory. The available memory depends on the OS. For more details, please check `system.actual.free`.

    - description: |
        Actual free memory in bytes. It is calculated based on the OS. On Linux this value will be MemAvailable from /proc/meminfo,  or calculated from free memory plus caches and buffers if /proc/meminfo is not available. On OSX it is a sum of free memory and the inactive memory. On Windows, it is equal to `system.memory.free`.
